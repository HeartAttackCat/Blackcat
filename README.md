# Tree balancing program in C.
## Made by Hunter and Cas

### Introduction
This program is a simple user interface which let's the user add data to a tree that self balances.

The program up until we implemented the remove node was easy. Once we got into the delete
node the amount of logic for different senarios expanded requiring a lot of different paths
for different senarios. Deletions are overall kind of difficult as I tend to run into segementation
faults due to logic falling apart.
